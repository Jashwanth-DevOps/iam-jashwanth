## 🎯 What I Do

✔️ Containerize applications using Docker & Kubernetes  
✔️ Manage cloud infrastructure with Terraform & Ansible  
✔️ Implement monitoring & alerting using Prometheus & Grafana  
✔️ Improve reliability, security, and scalability

## 💡 Why I’m Different

I don’t just *learn* DevOps tools — I **apply them end-to-end**.

While many engineers stop at theory or isolated tools, I focus on **complete DevOps workflows**:
from source code → CI/CD → containerization → cloud deployment → monitoring & observability.

I treat DevOps as a **mindset**, not just a role.

## 🚀 Why You Should Hire Me

✔️ I understand the **full DevOps lifecycle**, not just one tool  
✔️ I can **automate repetitive tasks**, saving time and reducing human error  
✔️ I focus on **reliability, scalability, and security**  
✔️ I can bridge the gap between **developers and operations**  
✔️ I continuously improve pipelines, infrastructure, and monitoring

I don’t wait to be told what to automate — **I look for inefficiencies and fix them**.

---

## ⚠️ What You Lose If You Don’t Hire Me

❌ Slower deployments and manual processes  
❌ Fragile pipelines that break under scale  
❌ Poor visibility into system health  
❌ Missed opportunities to automate and optimize  
❌ A DevOps engineer who truly owns the system end-to-end  

In short: **less speed, less stability, and more operational risk**.

---

## 🌟 What Makes Me Unique

✨ Strong foundation in **both development and DevOps**  
✨ Hands-on experience with **CI/CD, IaC, Kubernetes, and monitoring**  
✨ Clear understanding of **production-grade systems**  
✨ Curiosity-driven learner who adapts quickly  
✨ Ownership mindset — I treat systems as **my responsibility**

I don’t aim to be “just another DevOps engineer.”  
I aim to be the engineer **teams rely on**.
